# ROS1 visualizer

`xgc2-ros-visualizer` provides one C++ ROS server, one executable
`xgc2_ros_visualizer_node`, and the canonical catkin package
`xgc2_ros_visualizer`. A server owns a fixed input pool (default 2, maximum 32
workers), one publication scheduler, and a bounded XRPC Unix HTTP control loop plus one fixed domain worker.
Robots, descriptions and relays are instance data. Adding robots does not create
application threads, helper processes or `robot_state_publisher` children.
Core starts it through its process definition, discovers the service with
`GET /v1/describe` and applies the display configuration of its Run through
RPC. Normal Stop terminates that Run's native server.

The visualization of an experiment is a set of robot profiles. A profile holds
everything needed to draw one robot (model, state source, frames, path, labels,
animation, publish policy). The desired configuration of an instance is
replaced as a whole or one robot at a time; the server diffs it against the
applied state and rebuilds only the robots whose profile changed. Rates have a
per-kind table as the default and per-robot overrides. Saved profiles belong to
Core configuration; this server keeps the applied state in memory only.

This product owns FS150, Scout and Mecanum geometry, wheel/rotor animation,
frame names and path styles together with ROS subscriptions, publication,
scheduling, URDF parameters and required fixed/joint TF. Robot rendering is
implemented privately in `src/render/robots`; there is no separate robot
visualization package or description-publisher process. Meshes and URDF assets
remain in the robot description products. Gazebo shadow rendering, algorithm
planning, map production and Viewer rendering remain their owning products.

ROS1 visualization is the single implementation authority. If future ROS2 or
other visualization publishers need the same behavior, extract the shared
calculations from this implementation into a ROS-independent library then.

## Startup and RPC

Source a ROS Noetic environment and select its master/IP normally. The
supervisor supplies allocated `ROS_HOME` and `ROS_LOG_DIR` locations for native
cache/log ownership and the socket path inside its private runtime directory:

```sh
rosrun xgc2_ros_visualizer xgc2_ros_visualizer_node \
  --socket-path "$XGC_RUNTIME_DIR/sockets/visualizer.sock" --world-clock simulation
curl --unix-socket "$XGC_RUNTIME_DIR/sockets/visualizer.sock" \
  -H 'X-Request-ID: discover-1' -H 'X-Xrpc-Timeout-Ms: 3000' \
  http://localhost/v1/describe
```

The process ships its definition for Core, `process-definitions/xgc2-ros-visualizer.json`
(installed to `/usr/share/xgc2/process-definitions`): the executable, its
parameters, the service it hosts, readiness by `describe` and the stop grace.
The service contract, with every route, the profile schema, revisions and the
lifecycle, is in [docs/visualization-v1.md](docs/visualization-v1.md).

| Request | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /v1/describe[?wait_ready_ms=]` | Readiness envelope `{service, api_version, instance_id, ready, facts}`; the wait is answered without polling |
| `GET /v1/status` | Readiness, the rate table and every instance's status |
| `GET /v1/rates`, `PUT /v1/rates` | The per-kind default table; `{expectedRevision, rates}` replaces it atomically |
| `GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE /v1/instances/<id>` | Observe, apply a new desired configuration (only changed robots rebuild), or retract an instance |
| `GET`/`PUT`/`DELETE /v1/instances/<id>/robots/<robot>` | Observe, apply or remove one robot's profile |
| `GET`/`PUT /v1/instances/<id>/robots/<robot>/rates` | Observe or replace the rate overrides of one robot |

An instance PUT carries the full frozen public Robot array, the session context,
the panel settings and the display relays; the native product projects its own
visualization fields atomically and Core does not construct a second projected
roster. Empty rosters are valid. Configured scene instances, including
zero-robot worlds, publish `/xgc/robot_scene/ready`; this acknowledges
configuration, not fresh robot poses or scientific progress. Descriptions also
publish `/xgc/robot_descriptions/ready`.

```json
{"robots":[],"context":{"runMode":"simulation","worldClock":"simulation","worldBoundary":null},"settings":{},"displayRelays":[]}
```

Namespace, scene model and installed description metadata come from each
Robot's visualization configuration; the saved profile of a Robot is its
`visualization.profile`. The native FS150 AR projection selects the frozen
member's physical or simulation source, resolves its pose topic and applies
`context.localizationOffset` only to raw motion capture. Direct xsim
coordinates already include that offset. Numeric slot palette ordering and the
original Scout mocap scene-model binding are preserved. Unrelated panel fields
remain Viewer-owned.

Instances cannot share the existing global scene/frame outputs on the same ROS
graph. Independent relay-only instances can disable scene/transforms and use
disjoint display topics. Conflicts, duplicate models and duplicate path outputs
fail before anything changes. DELETE never publishes SceneDeletion
ALL or purges all ROS description parameters. A replaced foreign parameter value
is preserved during cleanup.

## Data and publication rates

All subscriptions remain active until their instance is deleted or the server
stops, regardless of Viewer connections. ROS input queues are size 1. Callbacks
update fixed latest state and fixed source-time history under short locks;
serialization, publication, URDF parsing and network I/O occur outside those
locks. The rate table is an immutable publication snapshot; a robot's overrides apply
from the next tick. Rate changes, membership changes and Stop wake the single
scheduler immediately, including when all rates are 0.1 Hz.

| Kind/channel | Default ceiling | Output |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| FS150/Scout/Mecanum `pose_tf` | 120 Hz | `/xgc/tf` body/label/camera and AR anchor transforms, new source stamps only |
| Each kind `joint_tf`, `markers` | 30 Hz | `/xgc/tf` visual rotor/wheel TF; optional `/markers` geometry/path/labels |
| Each kind `scene`, `scene_path`, `path`, `ar_path`, `ar_identity` | 10 Hz | `/xgc/scene` labels/optional paths, namespace Path topics, `/xgc/scene_ar` |
| FS150 `height_projection`, `height_projection_ar` | 10 Hz | `/xgc/uav_height_projection` and `/xgc/uav_height_projection_ar` |
| Global `tf_root` | 30 Hz | Standard `/tf` world root |
| Global `tf_static`, `world_boundary`, `readiness` | 1 Hz | Latched fixed aliases/URDF TF, world boundary layers and ready events |
| Global `joint_tf` | 30 Hz | In-process URDF joint TF for descriptions without a matching concrete scene kind |
| All kinds `display_pointcloud`, `display_grid`, `display_path`, `display_pose_array` | 10 Hz | Original serialized data under `/xgc/display` |

All applicable ceilings accept finite 0.1–1000 Hz numbers. The table holds the
defaults of every robot of a kind; a robot can override the channels of its own
kind row (not the relay channels or the scene-wide `global` channels) through
`PUT /v1/instances/<id>/robots/<robot>/rates`. Static, readiness and
label outputs are event-driven with ceilings, rather than periodic replay.
Description joint TF uses the matching robot kind's `joint_tf` ceiling when
available; global `joint_tf` does not override the three concrete kinds.
World boundary topics remain `/xgc/world_boundary`, `/xgc/world_boundary/ar`,
`/xgc/world_boundary_walls` and `/xgc/world_boundary_walls/ar`.

3D FS150 reads its fused `/<namespace>/mavros/local_position/pose`; ground robots
read canonical `/<namespace>/pose`. AR reads the exact frozen source with its
world offset once. Source stamps, finite/frame/freshness checks, the Scout body
height, ground-path z=0, raw AR quaternion and the off/ground/walls semantics are
preserved. Rotor state reads MAVROS state/extended-state; ground wheel animation
reads canonical twist, with cmd_vel as the existing fallback. The server never
writes those scientific inputs or controller parameters.

Nav Path, Marker path and Scene path use the same source-stamp sampled 6-second,
10-Hz, maximum-61-point ring. Lowering an output ceiling does not lower history
sampling, including with accelerated simulation time. History expires using ROS
time and respects rollback/reset semantics. URDF XML is loaded from installed
package-relative files. Parameters and fixed/movable joint transforms are
produced in-process using the original description prefix; no RSP is forked.

A wire relay request is `{source,topic,messageType}`; its kind comes from the
frozen Robot roster. Source names are unique
canonical absolute names outside `/xgc/display`; output is exactly
`/xgc/display` + source. Maximum 64 per instance. Only PointCloud2,
OccupancyGrid, Path and PoseArray full-state messages are accepted. The relay
receives serialized bytes once and publishes the same immutable pointer using
the original type/MD5/definition. It does not decode, rewrite Header sequence,
convert fields, replay previously published samples or budget the source itself.
The native relay representation also carries the product-projected kind. A wire
`robotKind` or individual relay rate field is rejected.

Membership, queues, latest-message retention and history point counts are
bounded. Variable ROS payload bytes and ROS serialization/transport allocations
remain message-dependent; this is not a claim of zero allocations or a universal
byte-memory limit.

## Build, package and validation

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/prefix -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/prefix
cmake --build build -j2
cmake --build build --target tests -j2
cmake --build build --target run_tests -j2
catkin_test_results build/test_results
cmake --install build
```

The control host uses the installed `XgcXrpc` 0.2 `http` component (C++17, plain
limit structs; nothing is read from the environment). The whole product builds
as C++17 with the Focal compiler; the runtime and contract libraries stay C++14
for their consumers. The SDK is not copied into this product.

The native package is `ros-noetic-xgc2-ros-visualizer`, version 0.5.0-1. It installs
one executable, the runtime/contract libraries, public canonical headers and
the process definition. Consumers use
`find_package(catkin REQUIRED COMPONENTS xgc2_ros_visualizer)`.
The installed Robot SDK ABI dependency is at least 0.2.0-16.

`.xgc2/scripts/build_debs_in_docker.sh` requires an immutable Noetic build image,
and installs published SDK dependencies only inside independent containers. It runs
source tests, produces the Deb, then installs that Deb in a second container and
checks the catkin exports, linkage and actual executable. CI selects these resources through `XGC2_FOCAL_CXX_BUILD_IMAGE` and
`XGC2_FOCAL_CXX`; images are selected by digest. This build requires
network access to production APT for dependencies; it never uses an active Core
container as its builder.

Two private-graph probes start their own `roscore` and run the actual executable:

* `test/profile_probe.py` covers this contract: describe and its wait, creating
  an instance, changing one robot's profile and checking, through the master's
  registry and the peer events of the fake robot sources, that exactly that
  robot's resources were rebuilt; saved profiles and panel settings reaching only
  the robots they change; scene switches that leave robot inputs alone; per-robot
  rate overrides, the per-kind table, revision CAS and rejected changes; adding and
  removing robots; output claims between instances; an unreachable and a replaced
  master.
* `test/installed_node_probe.py` covers the resource behavior: zero-robot
  readiness, four-type exact-byte relays, atomic validation, 20/100 robot
  resource counts, source-time paths at accelerated clock and low rates,
  in-process URDF joint TF, foreign parameter preservation, bounded DELETE and
  low-rate SIGTERM, restart and SIGKILL recovery without any resurrected state.

```sh
python3 test/profile_probe.py /opt/ros/noetic/lib/xgc2_ros_visualizer/xgc2_ros_visualizer_node
python3 test/installed_node_probe.py /opt/ros/noetic/lib/xgc2_ros_visualizer/xgc2_ros_visualizer_node
```

Private probes are correctness/resource checks, not formal station, browser or
scientific-mission acceptance. Source CI and Deb preparation do not imply
production APT visibility or live station adoption; the central release
workflow owns publication.
